# Solution Docs

<!-- Include documentation, additional setup instructions, notes etc. here -->
1. Git init, organize files into app & requirements
2. Investigate font, requirements, stack
3. Identify work to do:

SASS
    - Install sass
    - Reorganize sass files (scale, component, reset)
    - Script watcher

HTML
    - Symantic html
    - Accessibility/Events

Install Google Fonts  

Add Icon Font / Search Icon
* At this point I would probably pause and check in with design bc the demo-example.gif looks different from the design-spec.png, the typography scale is a bit unique and distinct even from space scale, would want to know more about min and max widths for the input/results/label and text wrapping/truncating behavior
** Would also probably get a quick consult from another developer on naming since I would next create some new sass files

HTTP ENDPOINT
    - Create HTTP endpoint 
    - Foo with callback(item)
    - Bind to search & results
    
Navigate using UP & DOWN & ENTER TO SELECT
    - Investigate events 
    - Refactor as needed


Next I would move to execution
4. Set up my environment
5. Install sass, spec out css files, script watcher, install google font
6. style and create theme
7. http endpoint
8. add mouse and keyboard events 

//TODO
Palette stylesheet
Icons close and search // remove input styles in shadow-dom
